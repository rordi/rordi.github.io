# Hi, my name is Dietrich Rordorf  ðŸ‘‹

But people typically call me *Didi*.

I am an IT and publishing professional with over 15 years of professional experience and currently serving as an IT Project Manager at [MDPI AG](https://www.mdpi.com/), which I re-joined in August 2020. Before I served as the CEO of [ditoy](https://www.ditoy.com/), a boutique digital agency in Zurich, servicing clients in a variety of industries. In 2016-2017 I was in a contracting role for [IWF AG](https://www.iwf.ch/) as a software engineer.

I originally joined the Molecular Diversity Preservation International association (MDPI) in August 2005 as Dr. Shu-Kun Linâ€™s assistant and, in 2010, co-founded MDPI AG, the publishing branch of the association. I subsequently served in the CEO and CTO roles of MDPI AG until my resignation in 2015. I also gained invaluable first-hand experience as an Assistant and Managing Editor of several journals including the *International Journal of Molecular Sciences* in 2006, and *Marine Drugs* and *Entropy* in 2007-2008. In 2008 I remotely trained the first editor that was hired by MDPI in China. 

You can check out some of my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/rordi/) or visit [Teacherflow](https://www.teacherflow.ch), a platform that we released in 2017 to connect the Swiss Yoga and Pilates communities. I hold a bachelorâ€™s degree in business & economics from the University of Basel, and [certified](https://www.scrum.org/user/298081) as Professional Scrum Product Owner (PSPO I) and Professional Scrum Developer (PSD I).

I am also blogging about [nutrition and health](https://www.meinflow.com/) (in German). You may also have a look at my [reading list](./reading-list.html). If you have any book tips, let me know.
