# Hi there, my name is Dietrich Rordorf  ðŸ‘‹

But people typically call me *Didi*.

I am an experienced IT project manager and full-stack web developer devoted to build beautiful digital experiences with
JavaScript, PHP, HTML, CSS, etc. I will be serving as the CEO of [Ditoy](https://www.ditoy.com/), a web agency in Zurich,
from January 2018 on.

I am also a co-founder and the Managing Director of [EDIQO](https://www.ediqo.com), an online English editing service for
researchers.

Previously, I was in a contracting role with IWF AG near Basel, Switzerland from July 2016 to December 2017. Before that,
I worked for the Molecular Diversity Preservation International association (MDPI), which I joined in August 2005. In 2010,
I co-founded [MDPI AG](http://www.mdpi.com), the publishing branch of the association. There, I served as CEO and CTO, and
gained invaluable practical experience as the Managing Editor of several research journals. During my time at the company,
I oversaw its establishment as one of the fastest growing open access, scientific publishers in the
world.

You can check out some of my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/rordi/) or visit [Teacherflow](https://www.teacherflow.ch),
a platform that we released in 2017 to connect the Swiss Yoga and Pilates communities. I was [certified as Professional Scrum
Developer PSD I](https://www.scrum.org/user/298081) in December 2017.
