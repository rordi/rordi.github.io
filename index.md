# Hi, my name is Dietrich Rordorf  ðŸ‘‹

But people typically call me *Didi*.

Currently I am the CEO at [ditoy](https://www.ditoy.com/), a boutique digital agency in Zurich. Previously, I was in a contracting role as full-stack developer with IWF AG from July 2016 to December 2017. Before that, I worked for the Molecular Diversity Preservation International association (MDPI), which I joined in August 2005. In 2010, I co-founded [MDPI AG](http://www.mdpi.com), the publishing branch of the organisation. There, I served as CEO and CTO, and gained invaluable practical experience as the Managing Editor of several research journals.

You can check out some of my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/rordi/) or visit [Teacherflow](https://www.teacherflow.ch), a platform that we released in 2017 to connect the Swiss Yoga and Pilates communities. I hold a bachelorâ€™s degree in business & economics from the University of Basel, and [certified](https://www.scrum.org/user/298081) as Professional Scrum Product Owner (PSPO I) and Professional Scrum Developer (PSD I).

I am also blogging about [nutrition and health](https://www.meinflow.com/) (in German). You may also have a look at my [reading list](./reading-list.html). If you have any book tips, let me know.
