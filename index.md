# Hi, my name is Dietrich

But people typically call me *Didi*.

I am a full-stack developer and IT / web project manager. Currently in a contracting role with [IWF AG](http://iwf.ch)
near Basel, Switzerland, I am devoted to build beautiful web apps with JavaScript, PHP, HTML, CSS, etc.

I am also a co-founder and the Managing Director of [EDIQO](https://www.ediqo.com), an online English editing service for
researchers.

Previsouly I worked for the Molecular Diversity Preservation International association (MDPI), which I joined in August 2005, and, in 2010, co-founded [MDPI AG](http://www.mdpi.com), the publishing branch of the association.

You can check out some of my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/rordi/) or visit [Teacherflow](https://www.teacherflow.ch),
a platform we recently released to connect the Swiss Yoga and Pilates communities.
