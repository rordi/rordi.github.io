# Hi, my name is Dietrich

But people typically call me *Didi*.

I am a full-stack developer, IT project manager and entrepreneur. Currently in a contracting role with [IWF AG](http://iwf.ch/)
near Basel, Switzerland, I am devoted to build beautiful web applications with JavaScript, PHP, HTML, CSS, etc.

I am also a co-founder and the Managing Director of [EDIQO](https://www.ediqo.com/), an online English editing service for
researchers.

Previously, I spent 10 years with the STM publisher [MDPI](https://www.ediqo.com/), which I joined as its first full-time
employee (besides its founder).

You can check out some of my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/rordi/) or visit [Teacherflow](https://www.teacherflow.ch/),
a platform we recently released to connect the Swiss Yoga and Pilates communities.
