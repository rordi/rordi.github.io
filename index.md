# Hi, my name is Dietrich Rordorf  ðŸ‘‹

But people typically call me *Didi*.

I am devoted to build beautiful things digital. Currently I am the CEO at [ditoy](https://www.ditoy.com/), the creative digital agency in Zurich, and a co-founder and the Managing Director of [EDIQO](https://www.ediqo.com), an online English editing service for researchers.

Previously, I was in a contracting role with IWF AG near Basel, Switzerland from July 2016 to December 2017. Before that,
I worked for the Molecular Diversity Preservation International association (MDPI), which I joined in August 2005. In 2010,
I co-founded [MDPI AG](http://www.mdpi.com), the publishing branch of the association. There, I served as CEO and CTO, and
gained invaluable practical experience as the Managing Editor of several research journals. During my time at the company,
I oversaw its establishment as one of the fastest growing open access, scientific publishers in the
world.

You can check out some of my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/rordi/) or visit [Teacherflow](https://www.teacherflow.ch),
a platform that we released in 2017 to connect the Swiss Yoga and Pilates communities. I hold a bachelor's degree in business & economics from the University of Basel, and [certified](https://www.scrum.org/user/298081)
as Professional Scrum Product Owner (PSPO I) and Professional Scrum Developer (PSD I) in December 2017.


I recently started my [blog on nutrition and health](https://www.meinflow.com/) (in German). You may also have a look at my [reading list](./reading-list.html). If you have any book tips, let me know.
