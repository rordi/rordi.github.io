# [Didi's](./) Reading List ðŸ“šðŸ¤“

This is my reading list - a list of books which I recently read, I am currently reading, or plan to read shortly.
I am most interested in technical and business books. I recently purchased a Kindle Paperwhite and use [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/)
to convert epubs or pdfs to Kindle's internal mobi format, when needed. *If you have any book tips, let me know.*
